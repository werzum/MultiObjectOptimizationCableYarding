Optimization of Cable-Road Layouts in Smart Forestry

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for the dissertation titled *Optimization of Cable-Road Layouts in Smart Forestry*. 
The work focuses on the development and implementation of multi-objective optimization techniques applied to cable-road layout planning, integrating high-precision geospatial data and machine learning-based methods. 
The repository is structured into three main components:

### 1. Main Code (`src/main`)
The core logic of the optimization algorithms, including the implementation of genetic algorithms, forest data processing, and simulation tools. This is where the primary models and computations reside.

### 2. Jupyter Notebooks (`01_Notebooks`)
A collection of Jupyter notebooks that document the processes, including data preprocessing, algorithm explanations, and visualizations. 
These notebooks offer an interactive way to explore the methodologies and visualize the results of the optimization and simulation processes.

### 3. Data and Outputs
The repository also contains datasets and model outputs generated during the optimization and simulation experiments, allowing for reproducibility and further analysis.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository and navigate to the `src/main` folder to execute the core code.
  - Note that the underlying forest maps are _not_ included - write me a message if you want to use this data for research.
- For exploration and visualization of the data and processes, open and run the notebooks in `01_Notebooks`.
- Adjust data inputs or parameters in the code for customized experimentation.
